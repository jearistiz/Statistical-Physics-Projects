# Satistical Physics Progects

This repository consists of three small projects that I worked on during a graduate course on Statistical Physics. Each project resides on one of the three directories of this repository

* 1: Monte Carlo simulations on quantum harmonic oscillator.
* 2: Matrix Squaring and Path Integral Monte Carlo python implementations for density matrix. Systems: QHO and Anharmonic potential.

# Satistical Physics Progects

This repository consists of three small projects that I worked on during a graduate course on Statistical Physics. Each project resides on one of the three directories of this repository

* 1: Simple Monte Carlo simulations on Quantum Harmonic Oscillator (QHO). Article written in spanish can be found at 1/entregable_tarea_1_juan_esteban_aristizabal_zuluaga/Articulo_Tarea_1_Fisic_Estadistica_Avanzada.pdf
* 2: Matrix Squaring and Path Integral Monte Carlo python implementations for density matrix. Systems: QHO and Anharmonic potential.
